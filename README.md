# Résidence Itylon – Modern Website Revamp

Welcome to the repository of **Résidence Itylon**, a stunning holiday destination featuring charming gîtes nestled in the heart of Corsica. This project is a complete redesign and development of their original website, offering a modern, responsive, and performant experience for potential visitors.

## 🌄 About

The aim of this project was to bring a fresh and elegant digital presence to Résidence Itylon by creating a fully customized website from scratch. The original website lacked responsiveness, modern UI/UX design, and speed optimization. This new version addresses those issues with a robust tech stack and clean architecture.

Whether users are browsing from mobile or desktop, the site highlights the beauty of the Corsican landscapes, the comfort of the gîtes, and the simplicity of booking a stay.

The project was built from the ground up using the following technologies:

### Frontend
- **Vue 3** – A progressive JavaScript framework for building modern user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework that helped craft a clean and responsive design.

### Backend
- **Express.js** – A minimalist backend framework for handling API routes and business logic.
- **Redis** – Used for caching and improving performance of dynamic content and sessions.
- **SQLite** – A lightweight, file-based relational database perfect for small-to-medium web apps.

### DevOps / Infrastructure
- **Docker** – The entire application is containerized to ensure consistency across environments.
- **Nginx** – Serves as a reverse proxy and static file handler to ensure fast content delivery and better scalability.
